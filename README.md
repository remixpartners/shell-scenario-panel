## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**Required: Research tool (choose one)**

**Option A: Gemini Deep Research (recommended)**
```bash
pip install google-genai
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-from-aistudio.google.com
```

**Option B: Perplexity CLI (original)**
```bash
npm install -g @dbmcco/pp-cli
pp config
```

**Option C: Claude WebSearch only (no deep research)**
No setup needed — WebSearch is built into Claude Code.

**Required: worldview-elicitor skill**

The worldview-elicitor skill must be available in your Claude Code environment. See [Skills Setup](#skills-setup) below.

### 2. Clone and Start Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbmcco/shell-scenario-panel.git
cd shell-scenario-panel
# Start Claude Code conversation
```

### 3. Tell Dr. Wells What You Want to Explore

Just describe your scenario planning needs:

```
"I need to develop scenarios for the future of AI regulation."
```

or

```
"Let's explore future scenarios for renewable energy infrastructure."
```

### 4. Dr. Wells Handles Everything

She will:
1. Initialize the scenario automatically
2. **Elicit your worldview** - understand how you think about this topic
3. Guide you through the 8-phase process
4. Consult specialists as needed
5. **Integrate scenarios with your worldview** - connect findings to your mental model
6. Ensure quality and documentation

**You never need to run scripts manually.** Dr. Wells manages the technical details.

## The 8-Phase Process

### Phase 0: Worldview Elicitation (NEW)

**Purpose:** Understand how you think about the topic before exploring external scenarios.

**Process:**
1. Dr. Wells invokes the worldview-elicitor skill
2. Natural conversation to surface your beliefs, reasoning, and uncertainties
3. Captures what would change your mind (cruxes)
4. Documents your mental models and frameworks

**Output:** `worldview_model.md`

**Also captured:** `phase_0_discovery/internal_baseline.md` (structured base case and risk posture)

**Why this matters:**
- Scenarios become more relevant (we know what lens you're looking through)
- Helps identify blind spots (where your worldview differs from scenario implications)
- Creates better buy-in (scenarios framed in your language/concepts)
- Reveals which scenarios you'll naturally resist or accept

---

### Phase 1: Understand the Focal Question
Clarify decision context, time horizon, scope, and assumptions

### Phase 2: Identify Predetermined Elements
Map trends already in motion (demographics, infrastructure, debt, climate)

### Phase 3: Identify Critical Uncertainties
Surface factors that could go multiple ways and matter for decisions

### Phase 4: Develop Scenario Narratives
Create 4 plausible, divergent future scenarios with memorable names

### Phase 5: Identify Early Warning Signals
Define observable indicators for each scenario

### Phase 6: Test Strategies
Explore strategy performance across scenarios, identify robust approaches

---

### Phase 7: Worldview Integration (NEW)

**Purpose:** Connect scenarios back to your mental model and prepare you for multiple futures.

**Process:**
1. **Belief-by-belief analysis** - Shows how each of your beliefs fares across all 4 scenarios
2. **Specialist reactions** - Domain experts comment on where your worldview might be missing something
3. **Crux-to-scenario mapping** - Shows how your uncertainties map to scenario boundaries
4. **Personalized early warnings** - Signals that would confirm or challenge your current view
5. **Reflection** - Exploratory conversation about what shifted in your thinking

**Output:** `worldview_integration.md`

**This is not persuasion.** The goal is helping you see how different futures connect to your existing understanding.

## Skills Setup

### worldview-elicitor Skill

The worldview-elicitor skill is required for Phase 0. It is bundled with this repository.

**Installation:**

```bash
# From the shell-scenario-panel directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/worldview-elicitor" ~/.claude/skills/worldview-elicitor
```

**Verification:**
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/worldview-elicitor/
# Should show: skill.md
```

See `skills/README.md` for more details.

## Key Features

### Worldview-Centric Design

The system is built around understanding YOUR perspective:
- **Phase 0** captures how you think before showing you anything
- **Phases 1-6** explore the external world objectively
- **Phase 7** translates findings back through your lens

This means scenarios are:
- More personally relevant
- Framed in language you understand
- Connected to your existing mental models
- Explicit about where they confirm or challenge your view

### Model-Mediated Guardrails

The system keeps reflection explicit while forcing constructive opposition:
- **Calibration:** user familiarity + facilitation stance (mirror / hybrid / analytic)
- **Not-knowing diagnostic:** actions, outcomes, causation, value, with tool matching
- **Mirror / Opposition / Synthesis:** preserve input reflection and stress-test it
- **Provenance logging:** new inputs tracked as claims with confidence and falsifiers
- **Progressive disclosure:** plain-language summary first, optional technical notes second

See `docs/model-guardrails-proposal.html` for the full guardrail rationale and implementation map.

### Transcript Enforcement

**Moderator (Dr. Wells) enforces transcripts** - hooks provide reminders only.

Multi-layer approach:
1. Specialist prompts with explicit transcript requirements
2. Moderator verifies transcript after each consultation
3. Post-task hooks remind of responsibilities
4. Metadata records all consultations with transcript paths

### Quality Gates

Automated quality analysis at key checkpoints:
- Phase 2 completion
- Phase 3 completion
- Phase 4 completion
- Executive Summary

Quality Analyst evaluates intellectual integrity and prevents regression to generic analysis.

### Scenario Management

```bash
# Initialize new scenario
.claude/scenario-init.sh

# List all scenarios
.claude/list-scenarios.sh

# Validate scenario completeness
.claude/validate-scenario.sh SCENARIO-2025-001

# Archive completed scenario
.claude/archive-scenario.sh SCENARIO-2025-001
```

## Philosophy

**Scenarios are not predictions.** They are:
- **Plausible** - Internally consistent and grounded in reality
- **Challenging** - Stretch thinking beyond comfortable assumptions
- **Relevant** - Illuminate decisions that need to be made
- **Divergent** - Explore genuinely different futures
- **Memorable** - People can recall and reason with them
- **Personal** - Connected to your worldview, not generic

**Worldview integration is not persuasion.** It's helping you see how different futures connect to your existing understanding.

The goal is preparing minds for multiple futures, identifying robust strategies, and making better decisions under uncertainty.

## Usage Tips

1. **Be honest in Phase 0** - The more accurately we capture your worldview, the better the integration
2. **Embrace uncertainty** - Saying "I don't know" is valuable information
3. **Notice resistance** - Scenarios that feel implausible may reveal blind spots
4. **Watch your cruxes** - The early warning signals for your specific uncertainties are most valuable
5. **Reflect genuinely** - Phase 7 reflection is for you, not for us

## Export to Keynote Slides

Convert your scenario planning outputs into a presentation deck using the keynote-slides skill.

### Export the brief

```bash
.claude/export-deck-brief.sh SCENARIO-2025-001
```

This consolidates: focal question, predetermined elements, critical uncertainties, all four scenarios, early warning signals, strategy analysis, and key specialist insights.

### Copy to your deck

```bash
# Create a new deck
cd ../keynote-slides-skill
scripts/new-deck.sh futures-deck --entity acme --title "Strategic Futures" --type strategy

# Copy the brief as materials
cp ../ai-simulations/shell-scenario-panel/scenarios/active/SCENARIO-2025-001/deck-brief.md \
   decks/futures-deck/resources/materials/
```

The narrative engine will help match your scenarios to storytelling frameworks like "Time Machine" (future vision) or "Rashomon" (multiple perspectives).
