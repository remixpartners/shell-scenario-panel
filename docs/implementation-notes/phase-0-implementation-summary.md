- `templates/scenario_suggestions.md` - AI focal question recommendations
- `templates/discovery_transcript.md` - Specialist research output format

### Prompts Updated (7 files)
- `prompts/moderator.md` - Added Phase 0 orchestration instructions
- `prompts/specialists/economist.md` - Added discovery mode
- `prompts/specialists/geopolitician.md` - Added discovery mode
- `prompts/specialists/ecologist.md` - Added discovery mode
- `prompts/specialists/futurist.md` - Added discovery mode
- `prompts/specialists/anthropologist.md` - Added discovery mode
- `prompts/specialists/contrarian.md` - Added discovery mode

### Documentation Updated (2 files)
- `README.md` - Updated to 7-phase workflow, documented Phase 0
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Added Phase 0 example workflow

### Testing
- ✅ Validated with grocery chain test scenario
- ✅ All templates work correctly
- ✅ File structure tested

## File Structure

Phase 0 creates this structure:

```
scenarios/active/SCENARIO-YYYY-XXX/
├── company.md
├── phase_0_discovery/
│   ├── scenario_suggestions.md
│   └── research/
│       ├── economist_discovery_round1.md
│       ├── geopolitician_discovery_round1.md
│       ├── ecologist_discovery_round1.md
│       ├── futurist_discovery_round1.md
│       ├── anthropologist_discovery_round1.md
│       └── contrarian_discovery_round1.md
```

## Usage

**To use Phase 0:**
1. Start new scenario
2. When Dr. Wells asks, choose "interview me about my company"
3. Answer 2-3 basic questions
4. Wait for 6 specialist research consultations (~10-15 min)
5. Answer follow-up questions based on specialist findings
6. Repeat if needed (typically 1-3 rounds total)
7. Review scenario suggestions and select focal question

**To skip Phase 0:**
1. Start new scenario
2. When Dr. Wells asks, say "I have a focal question"
3. Provide your question
4. Minimal company info captured, proceed to Phase 1

## Next Steps

- Monitor first production usage for issues
- Gather user feedback on discovery loop experience
- Consider optimizations if discovery rounds take too long
- Potentially add specialist selection (user picks 3-4 instead of all 6)

## Known Limitations

- Discovery takes 30-45 minutes (6 specialists × 2-3 rounds)
- No parallel specialist invocations (Task tool limitation)
- No automated convergence detection (relies on Dr. Wells judgment)
- Research tool failures require manual handling
